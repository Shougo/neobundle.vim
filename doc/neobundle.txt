INTRODUCTION					*neobundle-introduction*

*neobundle.vim* is ultimate Vim package manager.
This plugin is based on Vundle.vim(https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).
But some features is added.
For example:
 * Use vimproc when vimproc is installed.
 * unite.vim interface.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*neobundle-usage*

	In case when you run with files and buffers as the source
>
	:neobundle file buffer
<

	In case when you run with the initial input value foo
>
	:neobundle -input=foo file
<

The neobundle you started splits the window horizontally as default, opening on
the top of the Vim.  For example,
>
	:neobundle file
<
lists up the files of the current directory.  You may choose one of the
candidates by moving j or k, and typing Enter opens the candidate in a new
buffer.  That's the default action for candidates of which kind is file.  You
may also select an action with <Tab> on a candidate.  See also |neobundle-action|
about the actions.

You can narrow down the candidates with a keyword.  After opening a neobundle
window, the cursor goes on the right side of > in the 2nd line by typing i.
Then you can input a keyword to narrow down the candidates.  Each single
characters you type narrows down the candidates.  You also can use a wild
card * as an arbitrary character sequence.  For example
>
	*hisa
<
matches hisa, ujihisa, or ujihisahisa.  Furthermore, two consequence wild cards
matches directory recursively.  For example
>
	**/foo
<
matches bar/foo or buzz/bar/foo.  Note that you should consider using
|file_rec| that will be described bellow in most cases.

You may specify multiple keywords to narrow down, separating by spaces.
>
	foo bar
<
That matches candidates that match both foo and bar.

You may specify negative conditions with !.
>
	foo !bar
<
That matches foo but candidates that match bar will be rejected.

	You may add wild cards automatically with / if you specify files on
	-buffer-name option.  That's handy in case you select file with neobundle.
>
	:neobundle -buffer-name=files file
<
See also |neobundle_default_key_mappings| for other actions.

Screencast is available. Thanks ujihisa!
